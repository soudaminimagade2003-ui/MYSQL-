## Problem Statement

The cryptocurrency market generates a massive amount of data every day.
However, **raw data alone does not provide value unless it is structured, queried, and analyzed properly**.

### The key challenges addressed in this project are:

* Organizing crypto market data into a **relational database**
* Analyzing **investment patterns**, **coin performance**, and **exchange activity**
* Extracting **actionable insights using SQL only**

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

* To design a **well-structured relational database** for crypto market data
* To apply **core and advanced SQL concepts**
* To analyze:

  * Investor behavior
  * Coin-wise investment trends
  * Exchange-wise trading volume
  * Country-wise investment patterns
* To present insights in a **clear and professional manner**

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The project uses **multiple interrelated datasets** stored as CSV files and imported into MySQL.

### 📊 Tables Used

#### 🪙 `coins`

#### 🏦 `exchanges`

#### 🔁 `trading_pairs`

#### 👤 `investors`

#### 📈 `historical_data`

All tables are connected using **primary and foreign keys**, ensuring proper **relational integrity**.
